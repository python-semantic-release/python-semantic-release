Install
-------

::

    pip install python-semantic-release

Usage
-----

The general idea is to have some sort of tag in commit messages that
indicates certain types of changes. If a commit message lack a tag it is
ignored. Running release can be run locally or from a CI service.

      --post   If used with the changelog command, the changelog will be posted to the release api.
