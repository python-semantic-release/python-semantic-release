<!--
Please do not combine multiple features or fix actions that are not
directly dependent on one another. Please open multiple PRs instead because
one may be merged while the other is denied or has requested changes. This
will slow down the process of merging the accepted changes as reviews are
also more difficult to evaluate for edge cases.
-->

## Rationale

## How did you test?

describe the primary case and the possible edge cases that you considered and
ultimately how you tested them. If you didn't rule out any edge cases, please
mention the rationale here.
