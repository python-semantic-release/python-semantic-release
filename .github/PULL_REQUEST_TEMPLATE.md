<!--
Please do not combine multiple features or fix actions that are not
directly dependent on one another. Please open multiple PRs instead because
one may be merged while the other is denied or has requested changes. This
will slow down the process of merging the accepted changes as reviews are
also more difficult to evaluate for edge cases.
-->
