Upgrading to v9
===============

You are in luck! The upgrade to ``v9`` is a simple one.

The breaking change for this version is the removal of support for **Python 3.7**, as it has passed
End-Of-Life (EOL). This means that if you are using Python 3.7, you will need to upgrade
to at least Python 3.8 in order to use ``v9``. This will be permanent as all future versions of
``python-semantic-release`` will require Python 3.8 or later.
