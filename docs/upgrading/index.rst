Upgrading PSR
=============

Upgrading PSR is a process that may involve several steps, depending on the version you
are upgrading from and to. This section provides a guide for upgrading from older
versions of PSR to the latest version.

.. important::
    If you are upgrading across **more than one** major version, you should incrementally
    upgrade through each major version and its configuration update guide to ensure a
    smooth transition.

    For example, if you are upgrading from v7 to v10, you should first
    upgrade to v8 and then to v9, and then lastly to v10 while following the upgrade
    guide for each version. At each step you should confirm execution works as expected
    before proceeding to the next version.
