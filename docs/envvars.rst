Authentication
==============

.. _env-gh_token:

``GH_TOKEN``
------------
A personal access token from GitHub. This is used for authenticating
when pushing tags, publishing releases etc. See :ref:`automatic-github` for
usage.

To generate a token go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
and click on *Personal access token*.

.. _env-gl_token:

``GL_TOKEN``
------------
A personal access token from GitLab. This is used for authenticating
when pushing tags, publishing releases etc.

.. _env-pypi_token:

``PYPI_TOKEN``
--------------
Set an API token for publishing to https://pypi.org/. Information on how to
obtain a token is given `here <https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken>`_.

See :ref:`automatic-pypi` for more about PyPI uploads.

.. _env-pypi_password:

``PYPI_PASSWORD``
-----------------
Used together with :ref:`env-pypi_username` when publishing to https://pypi.org/.

.. warning::
  You should use :ref:`env-pypi_token` instead of username and password
  authentication for the following reasons:

  - It is `strongly recommended by PyPI <https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken>`_.
  - Tokens can be given access to only a single project, which reduces the
    possible damage if it is compromised.
  - You can change your password without having to update it in CI settings.
  - If your PyPI username is the same as your GitHub and you have it set
    as a secret in a CI service, they will likely scrub it from the build
    output. This can break things, for example repository links.

.. _env-pypi_username:

``PYPI_USERNAME``
-----------------
Used together with :ref:`env-pypi_password` when publishing to https://pypi.org/.
