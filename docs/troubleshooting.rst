Things to check...

- Check setup.cfg for :ref:`configuration`
- Check all applicable :ref:`envvars`
- Git tags beginning with ``v``. This is, depending on configuration, used
  for getting the last version.

.. _debug-usage:

Showing debug output
====================
If you are having trouble with `semantic-release` there is a way to get more
information during its work.

By setting the ``--verbosity`` option to ``DEBUG`` you can display information
from the inner workings of semantic-release.

.. note::
  Debug output is always enabled on GitHub Actions using the built-in action.

::

    semantic-release changelog --verbosity=DEBUG

.. warning::
  The ``=`` symbol is required between ``--verbosity`` and its argument, but
  not when using the short form of ``-v``::

    semantic-release changelog -v DEBUG

  See `#227 <https://github.com/relekang/python-semantic-release/issues/227>`_.
